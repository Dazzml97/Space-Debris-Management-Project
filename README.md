# Space Debris Management

## Project Overview
The "Space Debris Management" project aims to explore and analyze emerging technologies focused on the management of space debris. With the increasing commercial and private activities in space, the accumulation of defunct satellites, spent rocket stages, and fragments from collisions have raised concerns about the long-term sustainability of Earth's orbital environments. This project delves into the current state of space debris management technologies, focusing on patent clustering related to debris prevention, mitigation, and removal strategies.

## Key Features
Patent Analysis: Investigates global trends in space debris management technologies through detailed patent analysis.
Clustering Algorithms: Employs custom DBSCAN clustering to identify key technological trends in debris management.
Legal Framework Evaluation: Highlights the need for updated and more robust international legal frameworks to support the deployment of emerging debris management technologies.
Technological Insights: Categorizes innovations into prevention, mitigation, and removal strategies, offering insights into the strategic focus of various countries.
Policy Recommendations: Advocates for the introduction of economic incentives and policy reforms to stimulate further innovation in debris prevention and removal.

## Project Structure
